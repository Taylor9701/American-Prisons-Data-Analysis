"Note: Jurisdiction refers to the legal authority of state or federal correctional officials over a prisoner, regardless of where the prisoner is held. Federal data include prisoners held in non-secure, privately operated community corrections facilities and juveniles held in contract facilities. Estimates were provided by state and federal departments of corrections’ administrative record systems and may not reflect prisoners’ self-identification of race/Hispanic origin. State, federal, and national totals by race/Hispanic origin differ from other tables in this report due to adjustments made by BJS in other tables to correct for differences between administrative records and prisoner self-reported data of race/Hispanic origin.",,,,,,,,,,,,
~Not applicable. State does not track this race/Hispanic origin.,,,,,,,,,,,,
/Not reported. ,,,,,,,,,,,,
"a/Excludes persons of Hispanic/Latino origin (e.g., white refers to non-Hispanic white; black refers to non-Hispanic black). See Methodology.",,,,,,,,,,,,
"b/The Federal Bureau of Prisons does not separate out persons of Hispanic origin from the individual racial categories when reporting to the National Prisoner Statistics (NPS). To do so, BJS used data from the 2017 Federal Justice Statistics Program (preliminary).",,,,,,,,,,,,
"c/Asians, Native Hawaiians, and Other Pacific Islanders were combined in a single category and reported as Asian.",,,,,,,,,,,,
d/Florida counts from 2017 are not comparable to counts from years before 2016 due to a change in reporting methodology in 2016. See Jurisdiction notes.,,,,,,,,,,,,
e/Persons of Hispanic origin may be undercounted due to ongoing changes in information systems.,,,,,,,,,,,,
f/Prisoners of Hispanic origin are included in Montana’s individual racial categories.,,,,,,,,,,,,
g/State did not submit 2017 NPS data on race/Hispanic origin. Counts were imputed. See Methodology.,,,,,,,,,,,,
