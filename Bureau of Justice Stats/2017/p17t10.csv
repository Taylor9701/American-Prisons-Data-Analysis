"Note: Definition of non-U.S. citizen varies across jurisdictions. Use caution when interpreting these statistics. Unless otherwise noted, citizenship status is based on self-report of the prisoner upon admission to prison. Some jurisdictions use a prisoner’s reported country of birth to determine current citizenship. BJS changed the way it measured citizenship for the 2017 reference year, requesting that National Prisoner Statistics (NPS) respondents include all non-U.S. citizens in the physical custody of state and federal correctional authorities and those held in private prisons, while excluding prisoners held in local jails and in the custody of other jurisdictions. Data collected in the 2017 NPS should not be compared to previous years’ data. See Methodology.",,,,,,,,,,,,

/Not reported.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"a/Unless otherwise noted, citizenship status is based on self-reporting by prisoners at time of admission.",,,,,,,,,,,,
b/Includes unsentenced prisoners and those of all sentence lengths.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"c/U.S. and state totals for non-U.S. citizens by sex exclude California and Oregon, which did not report citizenship counts by sex.",,,,,,,,,,,,
"d/Prison population count is the sum of persons held in the custody of state and federally operated facilities and each jurisdiction’s private prison facilities. In 2017, the total custody population in publicly and privately operated state and federal correctional facilities was 1,379,579 (1,197,432 state and 182,147 federal), and the sentenced custody population in those same facilities was 1,339,729 (1,171,372 state and 168,357 federal). These counts exclude custody populations for non-reporting states (New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Dakota, and Rhode Island).",,,,,,,,,,,,
"e/Total U.S. and state counts of non-U.S. citizen prisoners for 2017, and male and female totals, are an undercount due to the exclusion of data from several states that were unable to report this information. The 92.4% of prisoners who are not counted as non-citizens are not necessarily all U.S. citizens, as some may be of unknown citizenship status.",,,,,,,,,,,,
"f/Citizenship data from the 2017 Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) should not be compared to previous years’ data. Federal counts are based on country of current citizenship as recorded in the BOP data system and exclude persons detained by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), or U.S. Customs and Border Protection. In previous years, BOP has provided counts of non-citizens to NPS that were based on a prisoner’s country of birth. ",,,,,,,,,,,,
