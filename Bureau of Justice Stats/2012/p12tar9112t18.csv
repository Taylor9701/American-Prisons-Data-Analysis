"Note: Counts based on prisoners with sentences of more than 1 year under the jurisdiction of state or federal correctional officials. Imprisonment rate is the number of prisoners under state or federal jurisdiction with a sentence of more than 1 year per 100,000 U.S. residents of corresponding sex, age, and race/ethnicity. Resident population estimates are from the U.S. Census Bureau for January 1 of the following year. Illinois and Nevada did not submit 2012 data to the National Prisoner Statistics Program, so their jurisdiction counts are imputed. See Methodology.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
