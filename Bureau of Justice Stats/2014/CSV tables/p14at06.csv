Note: The definition of non-U.S. citizen varies across jurisdictions. Use caution when interpeting these statistics. See Methodology.,,,,,,,,
/Not reported.,,,,,,,,
"a/Unless otherwise noted, BJS assumes that noncitizens are identified by individual jurisdictions as persons with citizenship of a country other than the United States as of December 31, 2014.",,,,,,,,
b/Total U.S. and state counts of noncitizen inmates for 2014 will be lower than expected due to the exclusion of California data. California was unable to report the number of noncitizen inmates in 2013 or 2014.,,,,,,,,
c/The count of noncitizens for the federal Bureau of Prisons excludes noncitizen inmates housed in private contract facilities. The federal Bureau of Prisons holds inmates age 17 or younger in private contract facilities; 67 such inmates were housed in contract facilities in 2014.,,,,,,,,
d/Prisons and jails form one integrated system. Data include total jail and prison populations.,,,,,,,,
e/State did not submit 2014 National Prisoner Statistics (NPS) data. Counts could not be imputed because state did not submit data for these measures to NPS in 2013.,,,,,,,,
f/Non-U.S. citizens are defined as foreign-born.,,,,,,,,
g/Citizenship based on inmate self-report.,,,,,,,,
h/State did not submit 2014 NPS data for these measures. Counts imputed based on percentage of noncitizen inmates and inmates age 17 or younger in 2013. ,,,,,,,,
