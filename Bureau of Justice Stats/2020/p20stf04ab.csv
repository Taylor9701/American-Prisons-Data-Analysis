"Note: Jurisdiction refers to the legal authority of state or federal correctional officials over a prisoner, regardless of where the prisoner is held. Rates and counts are based on sentenced prisoners under the jurisdiction of state or federal correctional officials. Imprisonment rate is the number of sentenced prisoners under state or federal jurisdiction per 100,000 U.S. residents or per 100,000 U.S. residents in a given category. Resident population estimates are from the U.S. Census Bureau for January 1, 2020. Totals include imputed counts for Oregon, which did not submit 2019 National Prisoner Statistics data. See Methodology.",,,,,,,,,,,
