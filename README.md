# American Prisons

This data analysis project originated with concerns about honesty in reporting about the various metrics used to look at the American prison system. Given that there are political incentives on either side of the aisle to more or less do things that are ethically questionable, it seems prudent to verify such claims in a way that is publicly visible, verifiable, and reproducible. The results showed a mix of information, some that is commonly presented, some that is not. Please do look through the notebooks yourself if possible.

Otherwise, the following Drive link is an excerpt of the presentation given on this very project. It does not cover everything, but it does look at the highlights. I ask that you understand that since this is an excerpt from an in-person presentation, it cannot clearly convey tone, so I will make my intentions clear here. I draw zero conclusions about the causes for any of the statistics presented, and I strongly encourage you not to. Any mentions of potential causes are simply meant as a starting point for open discussion about the potentially many areas of interest that would be reasonable to investigate further in relation to those statistics in an effort to find the cause. The hope being that, given this was in an academic environment, it may encourage further research that could help address problems we face as a society.
