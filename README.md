# American Prisons

This data analysis project originated with concerns about honesty in reporting about the various metrics used to look at the American prison system. Given that there are political incentives on either side of the aisle to more or less do things that are ethically questionable, it seems prudent to verify such claims in a way that is publicly visible, verifiable, and reproducible. The results showed a mix of information, some that is commonly presented, some that is not. Please do look through the notebooks yourself if possible.

Should you not want to do that, the following Drive link is an excerpt of the presentation given on this very project. It does not cover everything, but it does look at the highlights. I ask that you understand that any questions or ideas stated here are merely that, and no implications or conclusions are meant to be implied in any way. I say this because I won't have the opportunity to make that clear through tone and additional statements while you read it because, well, I'm not presenting it to you, you're reading it.
