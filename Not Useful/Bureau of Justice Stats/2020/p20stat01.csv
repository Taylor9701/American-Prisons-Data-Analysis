"Note: Jurisdiction refers to the legal authority of state or federal correctional officials over a prisoner, regardless of where the prisoner is held. Imprisonment rate is the number of sentenced prisoners under state or federal jurisdiction per 100,000 U.S. residents of all ages or age 18 or older. Rates are for December 31 of each year and are based on prisoners with a sentence of more than 1 year. Resident population estimates are from the U.S. Census Bureau for January 1 of the following year. As of December 31, 2001, sentenced felons from the District of Columbia were the responsibility of the Federal Bureau of Prisons. Total and state estimates for 2019 include imputed counts for Oregon, which did not submit 2019 National Prisoner Statistics data. See Methodology. Counts for 2018 and earlier may have been revised from previous reports.",,
