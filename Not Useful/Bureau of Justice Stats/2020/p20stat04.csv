Counts and percentages are based on prisoners with a sentence of more than 1 year under the jurisdiction of federal correctional officials. Federal data include adult prisoners held in nonsecure community corrections facilities and adults and persons age 17 or younger held in privately operated facilities. The Bureau of Prisons' race data collection does not include two or more or other race categories. Details may not sum to totals due to rounding. See Methodology.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
