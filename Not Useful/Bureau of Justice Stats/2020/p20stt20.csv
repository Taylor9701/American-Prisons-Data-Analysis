"Note: Use caution when interpreting these statistics. Unless otherwise noted, citizenship status is based on the prisoner’s self-report upon admission to prison and represents counts of prisoners held in the physical custody of state and federal correctional authorities and in private prisons, excluding prisoners held in local jails and prisoners in the custody of other jurisdictions, with the exception of states with an integrated prison and jail system. Some jurisdictions use a prisoner’s reported country of birth to determine current citizenship. For jurisdiction-level information, see Jurisdiction notes on the BJS website. BJS changed the way it measured citizenship for the 2016 reference year, requesting that National Prisoner Statistics (NPS) respondents include all non-U.S. citizens held in the physical custody of state and federal correctional authorities and in private prisons, excluding prisoners held in local jails and prisoners in the custody of other jurisdictions, with the exception of states with an integrated prison and jail system. Data collected after 2015 should not be compared to data for previous years. See Methodology. As of December 31, 2001, sentenced felons from the District of Columbia were the responsibility of the Federal Bureau of Prisons.",,,,,,,,,,
