"Note: For jurisdiction-level information, see Jurisdiction notes on the BJS website. Counts are for December 31 of each year. As of December 31, 2001, sentenced felons from the District of Columbia were the responsibility of the Federal Bureau of Prisons. Multiple states reported large changes in prison populations, admissions, and releases between 2019 and 2020 due to criminal justice reforms enacted to address the COVID-19 pandemic. Because these differences were not the result of changes in reporting methods, BJS made direct comparisons of 2019 and 2020 data, understanding that the criminal justice reforms may be temporary.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
