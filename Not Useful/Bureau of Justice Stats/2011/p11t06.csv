"Note: Rates have been updated from previous publications to account for new population estimates. Jurisdiction refers to the legal authority of state or federal correctional officials over a prisoner regardless of where the prisoner is held. Counts are based on prisoners with sentences of more than 1 year under the jurisdiction of state or federal correctional officials. Imprisonment rate is the number of prisoners under state or federal jurisdiction with a sentence of more than 1 year per 100,000 U.S. residents. Resident population estimates are from the U.S. Census Bureau for January 1 of the following year.",,,,,,,,,,,
