"Note: Jurisdiction refers to the legal authority of state or federal correctional officials over a prisoner, regardless of where the prisoner is held. Counts are based on prisoners with sentences of more than 1 year. Federal data include prisoners held in nonsecure, privately operated community corrections facilities and juveniles held in contract facilities. Imprisonment rate is the number of prisoners under state or federal jurisdiction with a sentence of more than 1 year per 100,000 U.S. residents of corresponding sex, age, and race or Hispanic origin. Resident population estimates are from the U.S. Census Bureau for January 1,2016. Includes imputed counts for Nevada and Oregon, which did not submit 2015 data to National Prisoner Statistics. See Methodology.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
