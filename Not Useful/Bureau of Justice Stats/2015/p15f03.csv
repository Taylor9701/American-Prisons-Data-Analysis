"Note: The scale for the number of prisoners does not start at zero to show the subtle change over time. Jurisdiction refers to the legal authority of state or federal correctional officials over a prisoner, regardless of where the prisoner is held. Federal data include prisoners held in nonsecure, privately operated community corrections facilities and juveniles held in contract facilities.",
